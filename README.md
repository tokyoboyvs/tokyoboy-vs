# Hi ![wave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) My name is Antonio

### Software Developer

Hey there, I'm Antonio a 23 years old young man. Currently, I'm knee-deep in an apprenticeship journey, splitting my time—40% hitting the books at school and 60% diving into the bustling world of work. You'll find me tucked away in a manufacturer's domain, specializing in aerospace and energy components.

My gig? Well, I'm the one behind the scenes, coding tools that lighten the load for my fellow factory folks. It's all about making their lives a bit easier, you know?

Beyond just punching in and out, my mission is bigger. I'm all about ramping up the quality of our work environment. I want every person in that factory to feel valued and pumped about what they do. Simplifying things, making each day smoother—it's what gets me going.

So yeah, that's me—Antonio, on a mission to sprinkle a little joy and efficiency into the daily grind for everyone around me.
